###Customizing your theme

All custom css exists in the style.css file. Also included is a style.less you can choose to edit and generate the style.css file


**Customizing your background.**

Open any HTML template and navigate to the bottom of the file, you will see div with the a class of "background" inside this div contains the image that is set to the theme's background. I have included 12 background images you can switch out to further customize Espresso and make it yours.

**You can find additional background images in the "Additional Backgrounds" folder included in Espresso Theme.**

`<div class="background">
<img src="img/010.jpg" class="image" alt="background">
</div>`
		
**Customizing the header and logo fonts.**

Change the path to your Google web font here:

`<link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Oswald:400,700' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>`

Don't forget to change the typeface in your style.css file. Example:

`h1,h2,h3,h4,h5 {
	font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;
	font-weight: 400;
	color: white;
	text-shadow: 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,.75);
	margin-bottom: 15px;
}`
